# Rebase b6ed9b1..89f16f6 onto b6ed9b1
#
# Commands:
#  p, pick = use commit
#  r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
#  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
#  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
#  f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message

# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out
